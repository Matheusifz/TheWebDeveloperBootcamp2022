<h1>Chicken</h1>

<p>
  The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of
  the red junglefowl originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a
  term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A
  male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen
  and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

  Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia,
  Southeast Asia, and East Asia, but the clade found in the Americas, Europe,
  the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. From
  ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to
  Greece by the 5th century BC. Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th
  century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the
  land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose
  III.
